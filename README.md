This is my first web portfolio. It is built in NextJS using a few libraries as Styled-Components, Framer-Motion or Three.js.

There I want to show my recently developed projects as well as my skills acquired during my years studying software engeneering.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
